KILLING TIME
Sitting on the stairway
Hoping that you're okay
Waiting patiently
For you to come back to me (What should I do?)
I don't mind the waiting
As long as there's still maybe
A possibility
For you to be true to me

I'll be sitting on the stairway
Till quarter 'til two
With nothing to do, baby, hey-yeah
But twiddle my thumbs and wait

Killing time
Waiting on you (Baby)
What should I do?
I'll be sittin' here waiting
Killing time
Waiting on you (Baby)
What should I do? (Baby)
I'll be sittin' here waiting

Look inside your mirror
I hope that you see clearer
To look behind yourself
And you will find me, yeah (What should I do?)
I've got your back, baby
The love I have, I'm saving
I'll be there for you
Just like I said I'll be

I'll be sitting on the stairway
Till quarter 'til three
With nothing to do, baby
But twiddle my thumbs and wait

Killing time
Waiting on you (Waiting on you)
What should I do? (What should I do?)
I'll be sittin' here waiting
Killing time (Oh)
Waiting on you (Waiting on you)
What should I do? (What should I do?)
I'll be sittin' here waiting (I'm waiting)

Oh, baby when you come back down
Don't forget the love you found in me
I know that you're gonna take time
Oh, remember I'm by your side
Don't worry, I'm down for you
No matter what you're goin' through
I'll be there, I'll be there
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Killing time (Killing time)
Waiting on you (Waiting on you)
What should I do? (What should I do?)
I'll be sittin' here waiting (Oh-whoa)
Killing time (Killing time)
Waiting on you (Waiting on you)
What should I do? (What should I do?)
I'll be sittin' here waiting

Killing time (Waiting on you)
Killing time (What should I do?)
Oh, baby, baby, baby (I'll be sittin' here waiting)
I'll be staring at the wall (Killing time)
I'll be (Waiting on you)
I'll be (What should I do?)
Wonder what should I do? (I'll be sittin' here waiting)
I'll be waiting, killing time, time (Waiting on you)
I'm looking at my watch (Killing time)
Killing time (Waiting on you)
Waiting on you, you
Killing time
Killing time
